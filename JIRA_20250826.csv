Update – Header Logo Missing on Tactis Homepage

*Issue:*
The Tactis logo is currently not displaying in the site header.

*Root Cause:*
The “Site Branding” block relies on the theme-supplied logo (enabled by default). However, in the Appearance → Evolve theme settings, the option “Use the logo supplied by the theme” was unselected, and no fallback logo file or path was defined. As a result, the branding block has no source image to render.

*How it happened:*

* While adjusting layout overrides (via Layout Builder), the header region persisted without the {{tactis_logo.svg}}.
* Reverting the homepage layout to default fixed layout inconsistencies, but logo dependency was not reset.
* Current {{page.html.twig}} correctly renders the {{{{ page.header['tactis_evolve_branding'] }}}}, but the block’s logic fails silently when no file path is present.

*Resolution Plan:*

# Navigate to Appearance → Evolve theme → Settings tab.
# Under *Logo image*, upload the correct Tactis logo ({{tactis-logo.svg}}) or provide the path (e.g. {{themes/custom/tactis_evolve/logo.svg}}).
# Save configuration.
# Clear Drupal cache.

*Next Steps:*
Once saved, the logo will automatically display via the {{page.html.twig}} render array.
Can you export a tactis logo for me in PNG? (not sure if its the same as the footer logo which I have)","27/Jun/25 12:16 PM;63f651e88ab3d6a635ed6a76;

I suggest, if its not already setup this way (I don’t remember), to allow a content author to create a section and choose the dark plum color as the background.  This allows that color to bleed to the edge of the browser.  Then the content author can place this block in the section.

This means that the block should work in every possible background a section can have and that means, you have to make sure the font color is white when the background is dark, but black when the background is light.

# We can set this up in the CKEditor.  use a template to setup a two column flex box and just let the user add whatever they want to each column.  we’d need styles for buttons, etc.  But it could be done.  And maybe we allow something like that anyway for a basic two column layout.
# However, if this is truly a new component, maybe we create a paragraph type.  How about calling it “Stats” which allows the user to enter everything in the left column (title, body, link), and then the user can “Add A Stat” which is just a stat (a title) and Description (body).

I like #2, just do that for now.

# Add a tag to the top title section (ie - WHAT WE DO)
# Create a card for each solution and display 3 across. Each card should feature the solution title, a short teaser text, and then a list of featured services. If a solution has more than 4 services, only display the first 4 and then add an “and more…” as the fifth bullet.
# Each card should be clickable and have a light grey bg (#FAFAFA) with a 1px solid #DDDDDD border.
# Since there are only 5 solutions, but space for 6, we are adding a CTA in the last spot with a title (Ready to Get Started?), teaser text, and button linking to the contact us page.
# Move the ‘Client Shoutout' block from the homepage to the bottom of the solutions and services landing page. Center the title and rename it, “What Clients are Saying”
