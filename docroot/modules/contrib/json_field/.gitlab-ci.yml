# GitLabCI template for Drupal projects.
#
# This template is designed to give any Contrib maintainer everything they need
# to test, without requiring modification. It is also designed to keep up to
# date with Core Development automatically through the use of include files
# that can be centrally maintained. As long as you include the project, ref and
# three files below, any future updates added by the Drupal Association will be
# used in your pipelines automatically. However, you can modify this template
# if you have additional needs for your project. The full documentation is on
# https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/gitlab_templates/
